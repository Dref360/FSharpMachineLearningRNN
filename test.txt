Even when the Montreal Canadiens get outplayed of late, they have Carey Price in net to save the day.
The Canadiens were outshot a staggering 52-27 by the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday night but Price's stellar goaltending and three special teams goals lifted Montreal to a 5-3 victory that extended their winning streak from the start of the season to nine games.
The Canadiens, coming off a 7-2 win in Buffalo on Friday night, is one short of an NHL record 10-0-0 start shared by the 1993-94 Leafs and 2006-07 Buffalo Sabres. Their next game is Tuesday in Vancouver.
"You have to give (the Leafs) credit, they came out hard," said defenceman P.K. Subban. "They knew we'd be a bit tired and they pushed the pace.
"They did exactly what any team would want to do. But we've got Carey Price in net and he gave us an opportunity to win the game."
Subban and Max Pacioretty each had a goal and assist, while Lars Eller, David Desharnais and Brendan Gallagher also scored for Montreal, which already has an NHL record nine regulation time wins to start the season.
"Our goal is not to break records, it's to win a Stanley Cup," said Subban. "I think we'll save the champagne or whatever anyone expects us to do for another day.
"Personally, I think all we've accomplished is a good start. That's really all it is. There's a lot of hockey left to be played. Everybody's going to be talking about a lot of things over the next couple of days and that's fine, but for our team, it's about the next game and getting ready to play our best."
Leo Komarov, James van Riemsdyk and Morgan Reilly scored for Toronto (1-4-2), which is winless in its last three games.
The Leafs had numerous chances, hit a handful of goalposts and became the first team this season to get three goals past Price. But it wasn't enough.
"We had quite a few chances, a five-on-three, but (Price) made some big saves.," said Leafs captain Dion Phaneuf. "Whatever you want to call them — momentum saves, game-changers, he was solid."
The Canadiens got the lead when Bernier was unable to hang onto Subban's cannon blast from the top of the right circle on a power play 10:53 into the game.
Toronto had a 23-11 shots advantage in the second but fell behind 5-2.
Alex Galchenyuk drove to the net and his rebound was banged in by Eller 1:54 into the second period.
Komarov got it back at 2:37 from in front to score after van Riemsdyk deflected Scott Harrison's point shot off Price.
Desharnais saw his pass on the rush up the right side go in off Michael Grabner's skate at 4:24 but van Riemsdyk got it back at 6:36, banging in the rebound of Phaneuf's shot off the end boards.
Pacioretty broke down the left side and beat Bernier between the pads shorthanded at 15:30 and Gallagher tipped a Subban shot in from the edge of the crease on a power play at 19:46.
Reilly scored 7:11 into the third when he picked the far corner with a shot on the off-wing on a rush.
Bernier is now 1-7-3 against Montreal in his career.
Byron Froese, recalled Friday from the Toronto Marlies, centred the fourth line in his first NHL game. The Leafs placed Tyler Bozak (lower body) and defenceman Jake Gardiner (undisclosed) on the injured list this week.
The Leafs return home to face Arizona on Monday.
Since being recalled back on November 26, the 23-year-old Toronto native amassed two assists and a plus-1 differential in five games while logging an average of 8:37 of ice time per outing. Those assists, meanwhile, also just happened to be the first two helpers of his NHL career.

Thomas, who last suited up for the Canadiens on December 9 against Boston, heads back to Newfoundland having already registered seven goals and 14 points in 18 games with Sylvain Lefebvre’s squad during the 2015-16 campaign.- Charles Hudon will play his second career game and his first at the Bell Centre since being recalled on December 8 from the St. John’s IceCaps. If he felt nervous Thursday night in Detroit, number 54 says she will probably feel even more butterflies in his stomach but expects that Saturday night will be quite the memorable evening.

"The magic comes back every time I set foot in the Bell Centre, even when I don’t play. Since I was drafted, it is always incredible playing at the Bell Centre, even for preseason games," noted the former fifth round pick at the 2012 draft in Pittsburgh. “It's always great to be there, but tonight is going to be a big game. You have to play hard for the full 60 minutes, not just 40 minutes like last game."

On Thursday in Detroit Hudon found himself alongside Sven Andrighetto on a trio centered by Brian Flynn.

"Sven and I have known each since last year. We have played almost the entire season together and we have good chemistry on and off the ice,” provided Hudon, who collected his first NHL point Thursday night with an assist on Andrighetto’s second period goal. “He's a fast skater. When I give him the puck, his goal is to skate hard and get the puck in the zone quickly. He’s a hard worker and I think things are going well these days."

- Following Saturday morning’s practice, coach Therrien confirmed that Nathan Beaulieu will make his return to the lineup after a one game absence, replacing Greg Pateryn.

“I think I can improve all parts of my game from the way I played last couple games,” acknowledged Beaulieu who watched the Canadiens previous game against the Red Wings from the press box of the Joe Louis Arena. “Just as a defensive core we haven’t been good enough. All areas can improve. We were generating more offense at the beginning of the season. So I think we just need to get back to basics. We need to get pucks through and get bodies to the net.”

Coming off a career high 64 games played last season, the 23-year-old defenseman looks for the silver lining in an otherwise frustrating situation.

“As a pro you always have to look for the positive in things. Whether you are being sent down or called up, or having ups and downs during the season, as a pro you always have to try and find the positive in those situations. I’ve been pro for a couple years now and it’s my job and my duty to try to find the positive in the situation,” offered Beaulieu, who has already matched his point totals from last season with 9 points through the first 29 games this year. “I have time to think and regroup. Obviously my play hasn’t been up to standard so they gave me a night off to think about it.”

- Having watched back-to-back third period leads slip away against the Boston Bruins on Wednesday night and the Detroit Red Wings the following evening, Jeff Petry and the Habs defense corps look to rebound tonight against the Senators.

“Throughout the course of the season you are going to go through ups and downs. I would say this is our chance to face adversity. Losing four in a row is not the ideal situation but I think it is important to show what kind of character this team has. It is not just going to happen that we just snap out of it. We have to work hard to get out of this and I think this group has the ability to do so,” explained the rearguard who recently turned 28-years-old on December 9. “I think we just need to clean up a few aspects. The last couple games we had leads in the third period and we have given up chances that have resulted in goals. It’s just a matter of when we have a lead in the third period to not give up chances. We have not been as sharp getting pucks out of the zone and teams are dangerous when you turn the puck over.”

At the beginning of the 2015-16 season timely goals from the blue-line helped propel the team to a record start to the year. With a lineup depleted by injuries, the Canadiens are looking to recapture that offensive spark.

“I do not have an explanation for why goals from the defensemen are down. Through the course of the season you will get bounces that go your way,” continued the Ann Arbor native who has three goals and eight assists to his credit this season. Obviously we have to put more pucks on net, our forwards are doing their job of getting to the net, so we as defenseman have to find a way to get more pucks through.”

- Saturday night’s contest marks the third clash between the two Atlantic Division rivals this season. The two combatants split the first two games of the season series, with both victories going the way of the road team.

- Puck drop is scheduled for 7:10 p.m. EST. The game will be broadcast on CBC, TVAS and CITY
